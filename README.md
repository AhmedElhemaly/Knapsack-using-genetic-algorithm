# Knapsack-using-genetic-algorithm<br/>
Solving Knapsack problem using genetic algorithm by following steps : <br/>
1- Encode the solution in chromosome then create random population (0's to leave the object or 1's to take the object, with same length of chromosome)<br/>
2- Evaluate the generations with fitness function which will determine is this solutions is good or not<br/>
3- If it is bad solutions then we make select best of them<br/>
4- Then perfrom crossover<br/>
5- Then perform mutation<br/>
6- then repeat from 2 to 5 till we reach our termination condition.<br/>
