# Knapsack-using-genetic-algorithm
Solving Knapsack problem using genetic algorithm by following steps : 
1- Encode the solution in chromosome then create random population (0's to leave the object or 1's to take the object, with same length of chromosome)
2- Evaluate the generations with fitness function which will determine is this solutions is good or not
3- If it is bad solutions then we make select best of them
4- Then perfrom crossover
5- Then perform mutation
6- then repeat from 2 to 5 till we reach our termination condition.
